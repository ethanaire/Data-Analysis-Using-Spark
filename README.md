This repository contains my submission for the ***Final Project: Data Analysis using Spark***. The original files were provided by the IBM Skills Network as part of the **[Introduction to Big Data with Spark and Hadoop](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-big-data-with-spark-hadoop)** course on Coursera.

## Project Scenario 

You have been tasked by the HR department of a company to create a data pipeline that can take in employee data in a CSV format. Your responsibilities include analyzing the data, applying any required transformations, and facilitating the extraction of valuable insights from the processed data.

Given your role as a data engineer, you've been requested to leverage Apache Spark components to accomplish the tasks.

## Project Overview 

Create a DataFrame by loading data from a CSV file and apply transformations and actions using Spark SQL. 

This needs to be achieved by performing the following tasks:

- Task 1: Generate DataFrame from CSV data.
- Task 2: Define a schema for the data.
- Task 3: Display schema of DataFrame.
- Task 4: Create a temporary view.
- Task 5: Execute an SQL query.
- Task 6: Calculate Average Salary by Department.
- Task 7: Filter and Display IT Department Employees.
- Task 8: Add 10% Bonus to Salaries.
- Task 9: Find Maximum Salary by Age.
- Task 10: Self-Join on Employee Data.
- Task 11: Calculate Average Employee Age.
- Task 12: Calculate Total Salary by Department.
- Task 13: Sort Data by Age and Salary.
- Task 14: Count Employees in Each Department.
- Task 15: Filter Employees with the letter o in the Name.

## Setup

Install the required libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file. The command syntax is:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the required employees csv file using the terminal command:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-BD0225EN-SkillsNetwork/data/employees.csv
```
